                                        I don’t claim to be an expert at anything.

                                        I know what I know,
                                        and what I don’t know, I can probably learn.

                                        Me personally...

                                        I have two little boys, Cameron and Dillan. And then there’s
                                        my lovely wife Amy, who’s managed to put up with me for years.

                                        I’m still not sure how she does it.

                                        I’m a collector of hobbies, my most recent being mountain biking.
                                        My lawn and a backyard garden have both taught me that I do not in fact
                                        have a green thumb. I also dabbled in woodworking for
                                         a while, but it just got too messy.

                                         I love a good laugh more than anything. 
                                         People say that I’m honest and I have a quick wit. 
                                         I’m not intimidated by much and I won’t hesitate to
                                         say what’s on my mind.


                                         Hire me You won’t regret it.
